    "The most popular and developed sport in the world is Football, and arguably the English Premier league is the most competitive, and it is therefore the most natural choice to study. The game of football is constantly evolving, and features that may be important in one generation may become less so later - there has never been an analytic definition of the game. This is where machine learning could prove invaluable.\n",

    "In this project, we look at applying statistical and machine learning methods, in order to attempt at predicting match results based on historic data of the teams that play the match. A majority part of the project builds a framework that takes raw match data and creates suitable features based on historic statistics to match results. We then by using Decision trees and Random forest classifiers and finally we build deep learning logic, combine it with a number of feature selection tools, including PCA, to get the best accuracy metric."

    "As previously stated, the use of machine learning in the gambling industry has grown in recent past. Along with this steady academic interest has also shot up as well with many academic journals and papers detailing the methodology and results gathered. One such study (PETTERSSON,NYQUIST,2017)[1] used recurrent neural networks to predict the outcome of games with in-game infomration as the game progressed; the study used an accuracy metric, which ranged from 33.5% to 98% as the game progressed. Another study (HERBINET, 2018)[2] used publically available databases along with classical machine learning algorithms (regression, svm etc) to predict match outcomes and expected goals using aggregated statistics and player ratings. The study managed to accurate predict outcome of matches 50% of time.\n",
